## 🔐 Role-Based Access Control Testing

The test suite thoroughly validates your role-based access control:

### Admin Role
- ✅ Can process payments
- ✅ Can mark payments as unpaid
- ✅ Can cancel payments
- ✅ Can access all payment information

### Collector Role
- ✅ Can process payments
- ✅ Can mark payments as unpaid
- ✅ Cannot cancel payments (admin only)
- ✅ Can access payment information

### Member Role
- ❌ Cannot process payments
- ❌ Cannot modify payment status
- ✅ Can view payment history
- ✅ Can view payment summary
- ✅ Can view unpaid members

### Non-Member Role
- ❌ Cannot access any payment endpoints
- ❌ Properly blocked with 403 status

## 🚦 Rate Limiting Testing

- **Payment Processing**: Tests rate limiting on `/process-payment` endpoint
- **General Endpoints**: Tests rate limiting on other payment endpoints
- **Concurrent Requests**: Sends multiple requests to validate behavior
- **Testing Mode**: Accounts for your current permissive rate limits

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Test Data
```javascript
// Modify test users in test-payment.js
const testUsers = {
  admin: {
    fullName: 'Your Admin User',
    phoneNumber: '+251912345678',
    // ... more fields
  }
};
```

### Base URL
```javascript
// Change server URL in test-payment.js
const BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3001'; // Your server URL
```

### Individual Test Execution
```javascript
// Import specific test functions
const { testProcessPayment, testGetPaymentHistory } = require('./test-payment.js');

// Run only what you need
await testProcessPayment();
await testGetPaymentHistory();
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. **Connection Refused**
- Ensure your backend server is running on port 3001
- Check if the port is available and not blocked

### 2. **MongoDB Connection Issues**
- Start Docker containers: `docker-compose up -d`
- Verify MongoDB is accessible on port 27021

### 3. **Equb Creation Issues**
- Ensure the equb creation endpoint is working
- Check if all required fields are properly set

### 4. **User Role Issues**
